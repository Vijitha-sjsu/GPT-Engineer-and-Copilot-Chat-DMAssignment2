We will be using the tkinter library for creating the GUI and the MVC pattern for structuring the code. The MVC pattern separates the application into three components: Model, View, and Controller. 

The Model represents the data and the rules of the application. The View represents the user interface and anything that the user interacts with on the screen. The Controller handles the input from the user and updates the Model and View accordingly.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `CalculatorModel`: This class will represent the Model in the MVC pattern. It will contain the logic for performing the calculator operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

2. `CalculatorView`: This class will represent the View in the MVC pattern. It will contain the code for creating the GUI and displaying the result to the user.

3. `CalculatorController`: This class will represent the Controller in the MVC pattern. It will handle the input from the user and update the Model and View accordingly.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will create instances of the Model, View, and Controller, and start the main event loop of the tkinter GUI.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
